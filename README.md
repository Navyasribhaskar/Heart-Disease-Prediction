# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

# Overview
A machine learning model that predicts the risk of heart disease based on patient data such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.

# Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Logistic Regression
- Matplotlib for visualization

# How It Works
1. Preprocess the dataset and clean missing values.
2. Split data into training and testing sets.
3. Train a Logistic Regression model.
4. Evaluate model accuracy and ROC curve.

# Results
Achieved an accuracy of ~83% with strong performance on validation data.
